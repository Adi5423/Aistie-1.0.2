Just a testing for the main Aistie Final launch , i used Groq API Service to test how API's work how to work with them not gonna be using someone's else API Key for our product.

Now she uses a basic local server host 8080 with a basic GUI Web Application by html and css and backhend with python , to test the Aistie 1.0.2 testing version.
used speech2text and text2speech to create temporary audio file files to be spoken by the main Module , gonna remove this cause of latency in the response due the temporary creation of .wav files to bespoken. 

Just used this to try a upgrade in Voice of Aistie.
